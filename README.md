# Go Together Web Application
Welcome to the Go Together web application! This project aims to connect students going to the same destination by providing a platform to share plans and contact information. Users can submit their current location, intended destination, and departure time through a user-friendly form. The submitted data is stored in a database, rendered on the server side, and displayed on the home page using HTML.

# Features

Outing Plans Display:

Submitted outing plans are dynamically displayed on the web page, allowing students to see who is going to a particular destination and when.

Connect with Other Students:

Students can use the website to find others going to the same destination. The platform facilitates communication by providing contact information.

User Authentication:

To ensure the security and authenticity of the data, users must be logged in to access the form submission feature and view travel information.

# How It Works
